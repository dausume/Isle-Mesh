## What is this project?

This test case demonstrates **two fundamental deployment patterns** for microservices:

### Isolation Mode
Services run independently and can be distributed across multiple machines.
- Label: `mesh.isolation=true`
- Use case: Production, distributed deployments

### Suite Mode
Services run together on one machine with shared networking.
- Label: `mesh.suite=true`
- Use case: Development, small-scale production

---

## Quick Reference

### Test Both Modes
```bash
./test-deployment.sh both
```

### Run Isolation Mode
```bash
cd service-a && docker-compose up -d
cd service-b && docker-compose up -d
```

### Run Suite Mode
```bash
cd suite && docker-compose up -d
```

### Verify Deployment Mode
```bash
# Check if running in isolation mode
docker inspect service-a-isolation | jq '.[0].Config.Labels["mesh.isolation"]'

# Check if running in suite mode
docker inspect service-a-suite | jq '.[0].Config.Labels["mesh.suite"]'
```

---

## Key Concepts

### Label System
Labels enable automated deployment decisions:

```yaml
# Isolation
labels:
  mesh.isolation: "true"
  mesh.suite: "false"
  mesh.deployment.standalone: "true"

# Suite
labels:
  mesh.isolation: "false"
  mesh.suite: "true"
  mesh.deployment.standalone: "false"
  mesh.suite.role: "data-provider"
```

### Service Communication

**Isolation:** No inter-service communication (each service is independent)
```bash
curl http://localhost:6001/api/process
# Returns: "integration": "not-configured"
```

**Suite:** Services communicate via shared network
```bash
curl http://localhost:6001/api/process
# Returns: "integration": "success" with data from Service A
```

## Use Case Decision Tree

```
Need to deploy services?
│
├─ Development/Testing?
│  └─> Use Suite Mode (QUICKSTART.md)
│
├─ Small Production (1 machine)?
│  └─> Use Suite Mode (README.md + DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md)
│
├─ Large Production (multiple machines)?
│  └─> Use Isolation Mode (ARCHITECTURE.md + DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md)
│
├─ Need SSL/TLS and routing?
│  └─> Add Mesh Proxy (MESH-PROXY-INTEGRATION.md)
│
└─ Need advanced features?

## Testing Workflow

### 1. Initial Test
```bash
./test-deployment.sh both
```

This tests both modes automatically and verifies:
- Services start correctly
- Endpoints respond
- Labels are set properly
- Integration works (suite mode)
- No integration (isolation mode)

### 2. Manual Testing

**Isolation Mode:**
```bash
./test-deployment.sh isolation
curl http://localhost:5001/health
curl http://localhost:6001/health
```

**Suite Mode:**
```bash
./test-deployment.sh suite
curl http://localhost:5001/health
curl http://localhost:6001/api/process
```

### 3. Cleanup
```bash
./test-deployment.sh cleanup
```

## Integration with IsleMesh

This pattern is designed to work with the broader IsleMesh ecosystem:

- **mesh-proxy**: Add routing and SSL (see MESH-PROXY-INTEGRATION.md)
- **isle-cli**: Could generate these configs automatically
- **mdns**: Service discovery for isolation mode
- **VLAN**: Network isolation in suite mode

---

## Contributing

To extend this pattern:

1. Add new services in isolation mode first
2. Test integration in suite mode
3. Update documentation
4. Add tests to test-deployment.sh
5. Document in appropriate .md file

---

## Support

For issues or questions:
1. Check DEPLOYMENT-GUIDE.md "Troubleshooting" section
2. Review ARCHITECTURE.md for technical details
3. Check existing documentation
4. Create issue in IsleMesh repo
