# App dead-drops

For applications that only need to operate at the household, local business, and organizational level,
it is more than sufficient to just supply application dead-drops.  

These give people a basic means by which to install open source applications critical to their operations, 
which don't really need to operate over reticulum.

For most organizations and applications, this is likely more than sufficient, a vast majority of apps do not need significant amounts
of compute resources, networking, or communications at long distances.
