# Mesh Prototypes

This directory contains **hand-crafted mesh environment prototypes** that serve as reference implementations and learning materials for Isle-Mesh functionality.

## Purpose

These prototypes are intentionally built **without using the CLI tool** to:
- Understand the inner workings of mesh networking
- Test and validate core functionality manually
- Serve as reference implementations for CLI automation
- Document best practices for mesh-app architecture

## Important Distinction

- **`/mesh-prototypes`** (this directory): Hand-crafted prototypes built WITHOUT the CLI
- **`/test-mesh-apps`**: Automated test cases built WITH the CLI tool

## Prototypes

Each subdirectory contains a self-contained mesh environment prototype with its own documentation.
