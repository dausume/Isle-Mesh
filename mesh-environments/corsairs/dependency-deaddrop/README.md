# Dependency Deaddrops

Dependencies should be broadcasted over open broadcasts overtly, with clear encyption PKI signatures so that
individual dependency broadcasters can be varified as 'credible' over time by groups analyzing the code and comparing
them to the originals to ensure they are valid.

These should be sent out ideally by radio with as high a bandwidth as is feasible, with occasional packets indicating what dependency
is being broadcasted for confirmation, and contant PKI for confirming it is a valid broadcast and not being falsified by others
attempting to hijack the broadcast to hack users.

These can be used to do 'dead-drops' of dependencies for software, such that it is feasible to build apps locally
for anyone using devices with mesh containers and a reciever for the particular signal type.
