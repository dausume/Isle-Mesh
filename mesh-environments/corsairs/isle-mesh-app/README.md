# IsleMesh App

These are genuine mesh apps which can utilize reticulum to operate in adversarial situations,
at-scale, and at variable mesh and state-propagation capabilites based on network resources
that can be whatever random comm tools you have on hand that are available.

These should provide a set of 'state end-point PKIs' which provide public keys paired with a communication method or bandwidth,
which give a set of 'locations' where app-state deltas can be sent to.

The 'current state' as well as the 'deltas applied' should be periodically broadcasted by the IsleMesh App.

The Application itself, may be a pre-configured dead-drop of the application made to send state back via reticulum.
