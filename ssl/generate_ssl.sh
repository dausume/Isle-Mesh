# @startup_script/generate_ssl.sh

# This is meant to wrap ssl generation to make it easier to use with other .sh files for initializing
# docker compose setups automatically.  This is for making a single SSL cert via environment variables,
# for orchestrating SSL for a more complex app or compose setup, use the generate_ssl_orchestration.sh file.
# This is designed for securing simple apps on mesh-networks through automated orchestration.

# Example usage in a .sh file, made for a containerized nginx proxy being used just for the local device:
# BASE_DIR set automatically in the container, should be something like ...
# export CERT_DIR=nginx/ssl/certs
# export KEY_DIR=nginx/ssl/keys
# export CERT_AND_KEY_NAME=proxy_ssl_cert
# export SSL_URL=localhost
# If your cert has expired (expires once per year), re-run this with the extra option to re-make your cert
# WARNING: If your server has two-way connections, you should instead 
# export OVERWRITE_SSL=true

# Example usage when making the ssl specific to an endpoint serving an independent server from a virtual machine
# being served through an nginx proxy, using ECC protocol.

# Exit on error
